## *Project 2*

* Report is found in `Project`
* All scripts are found in `Src`
* All figures used in the report can be found in `Figures`


# **Packages**
The required packages are 
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `sklearn`
* `JAX`


# **Execution**
Run `decent_main.py` to generate everything related to the analysis of the gradient descent methods. `FFNN_main.py` will generate the plots and data related to the usage of neural networks on regression problems. `FFNN_Wisconsin_main.py` contains the plots and data for the classification problem, both the neural network and logistic regression. 
The rest are used as libraries for the `main` scripts. 

Make sure that all the scripts are in the same folder! Also, you have to change the directory in all the `main` scripts to your own to save the plots.
