* All scripts are found in `Src`
* All figures used in the report can be found in `Figures`


# **Packages**
The required packages are 
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `sklearn`
* `imageio`


# **Execution**
`frankefunction.py` and `Terrain_plot.py` will both plot the 3D figures shown in the report in addition to the raw terrain data. 
All the other output that is related to the Franke function is found in `Franke_main.py` and is generated when run. Similarly,
all the data related to the terrain data is generated by running `Terrain_main-py`. The rest of the scripts are used 
as libraries in the main scripts.

Make sure that all the scripts are in the same folder!
